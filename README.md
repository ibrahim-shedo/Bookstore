# Bookstore Project

## Overview
The **Bookstore Project** is a comprehensive application designed to manage the operations of an online or physical bookstore. It supports functionalities such as browsing, searching, adding, and purchasing books. This project is built using a combination of languages and technologies to demonstrate a wide range of programming and web development skills.

## Features
- **Book Inventory Management**: Add, update, delete, and view book records.
- **User Interface**: Clean and interactive front-end using HTML and CSS.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books by title, author, or genre.
- **Book Details**: Detailed information about each book.
- **Purchasing System**: Basic implementation for handling purchases.
- **Responsive Design**: User interface adapts to different screen sizes.
- **XML Support**: Data representation with XSLT for dynamic content rendering.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main logic, data handling, and backend processing.
- **Cython**: Performance optimization of Python code.
- **C**: Core modules for processing and backend operations.
- **C++**: Advanced operations and object-oriented handling.
- **HTML/CSS**: Front-end structure and styling.
- **XSLT**: Data transformation and rendering of XML-based content.

## Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/bookstore_project.git
   cd bookstore_project
Set Up the Python Environment

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
Compile C and C++ Code

Use gcc or g++ to compile C/C++ code:
bash
Copy code
gcc backend/transactions.c -o transactions
g++ backend/utilities.cpp -o utilities
Cython Compilation

Compile the .pyx files using cythonize:
bash
Copy code
cythonize -i backend/optimizations.pyx
Run the Project

Start the main Python application:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Access the bookstore UI: Open index.html in a web browser.
Interact with the system: Use the web interface for book operations and purchase simulations.
Book Data: The application reads data from books.xml and displays it dynamically using XSLT.
